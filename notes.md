Email testing: Email on Acid is recommended, but Litmus is another option. 

600px max-width is considered the safest max width for emails

Preferred doctype for html emails for best rendering across email clients:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">
```

If using a email client, remove comments from html, comments can get your email sent to spam

When adding margin, use a capital M (for outlook)
